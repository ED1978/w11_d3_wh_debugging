Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
  The breakpoint pauses the code just before the line where the breakpoint is placed executes.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
  No, the code pauses just before the line executes.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
  We use the step over feature to step to the next line of code.

4. What does the step into command do?
  If the breakpoint is set on a line that calls a function, step into allows us to delve into that function and step over and evaluate each line of it.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression allows us to evaluate expressions using variable that already exist and evaluate code fragment allows us to evaluate full code snippets and create temporary variables for use in them.
